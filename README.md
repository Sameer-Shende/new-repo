Retail banks offer their services to the general public and usually have branch offices as well as main offices for the convenience of their customers.

**Commercial or Corporate Banks**

Commercial or corporate banks tailor their services to business clients, from small business owners to large, corporate entities.

**Investment Banks**

Investment banks focus on providing corporate clients with complex services and financial transactions such as underwriting and assisting with merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. They are primarily financial intermediaries in these transactions.
